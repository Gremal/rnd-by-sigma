            description: "Vid den här nivån bör man förstå grundläggande semantik. Hur man använder <header>, <footer>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside> på korrekt sätt. Vad <table> ska användas till och vad man absolut inte ska göra med den. Strukturera rubriknivåer korrekt. Använda <form> och <input> samt alla fälttyper och valideringsegenskaper. Kunna avgöra när man använder <a> eller <button>. Använda <div> och <span> ansvarsfullt."

    title: "Data Formats"
    description: "When it comes to front end there are mainly three popular data formats JSON, YAML and XML. XML used to be the most widely used, but has succumbed in favor of the lighter and less verbose formats. You are likely to see these data formats being used in varying situations e.g. configuration, data transactions and persistance."

    title: "Tooling - Linting"
    description: "Linting is a form of static code analysis that aims to find syntax errors and enfore best practices. It has been adopted in other languages such as Java and C# for quite some time, while front end has caught on in recent years. It started with JSLint which was very opinionated which led to the creation of JSHint which was more flexible. Since these tools focused on best practices there was also JSCS for checking code style and format. All of these tools have now been succeeded by ESLint which is a plugin based and extendable ruleset. For CSS (and preprocessor languages) we have the equivalent which is stylelint."
